# SQL-Based Data Analysis & Transformation

## Overview
This project consists of two SQL tasks that focus on **data extraction, transformation, and analysis** using **complex queries, joins, and indexing** to optimise database performance and derive meaningful insights.

## Tasks
### **Task 1: Data Extraction & Cleaning**
- **Objective**: Extract and clean data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Key Features**:
  - Removing duplicates and handling missing values.
  - Applying **string functions** and **date manipulations**.
  - Ensuring **data integrity** using constraints and validation checks.
- **Results**: Cleaned, structured data ready for advanced analysis.

### **Task 2: Data Aggregation & Optimisation**
- **Objective**: Perform aggregations and query optimisations for large datasets.
- **Key Features**:
  - Using **JOIN operations** (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) for relational data analysis.
  - Implementing **GROUP BY and HAVING clauses** for summarisation.
  - **Indexing & Query Optimisation** for performance improvement.
- **Results**: Faster query execution and structured insights from relational databases.

## Requirements
- SQL-compatible Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server)
- SQL IDE (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or SSMS)

## Usage
1. Open `@00756100_task1.sql` and execute in your preferred SQL environment.
2. Run `@00756100_task2.sql` to perform aggregations and optimisations.
3. Analyse query results and modify queries as needed.

## Results
- **Structured and cleaned data** for advanced analysis.
- **Optimised queries** for better database performance.
- **Insights extracted** using advanced SQL operations.
